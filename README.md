# Deploy Static Website on AWS
This project empowers me to deploy a static website on AWS that requires no server-side processing. 


#### Functionalities:
* Create an S3 bucket, configure the bucket for website hosting, and secure it using IAM policies.
* Upload the website files to your bucket and speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront.
* Access your website in a browser using the unique S3 endpoint.
